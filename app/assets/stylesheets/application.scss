// Note:
// 1. './' is used to denote file are loaded from current directory
// 2. ./foundation-settings.scss is setting file
// 3. ./foundation-custom.scss is custom styles based on Foundation
@import './foundation-settings';
@import './foundation-custom';
// You need to import every other SCSS file manually
// Only in that case it will share Foundation 6 varables, e.g.:
// @import './codersclan';
@include foundation-everything;
