    <h2>To be financially responsible</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of Glen Jarvis, LLC is to give enough financial freedom to our members so they have the capacity to enjoy their life and intellectual pursuits. This means we take responsibility for the financial situations that affect our business and personal lives. It also means that we use money as a tool for happiness and not allow the pursuit of money to make us unhappy.

  <div class="span4">
    <h2>To be transparent</h2>
    <p>
      To the extent possible, we wish to be transparent. This means posting our financial statements online, communicating our mission and goals, and being as public as possible while still being responsible for our client's privacy and intellectual property.
